[Allora](https://www.allora.network/) is a self-improving decentralized AI network

The primary goal of Allora is to be the marketplace for intelligence. In other words, Allora aims to incentivize data scientists (workers) to provide high-quality inferences as requested by consumers. Inferences include predictions of arbitrary future events or difficult computations requiring specialized knowledge.

This blueprint is designed to assist in deploying a single node or a Highly Available (HA) [Fantom read-only node](https://docs.fantom.foundation/node/tutorials/run-a-read-only-node) on AWS. It is intended for use in development, testing, or Proof of Concept purposes.
