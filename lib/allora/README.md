[Allora](https://www.allora.network/) is a self-improving decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) network. The primary goal of the network is to be the marketplace for intelligence. In other words, Allora aims to incentivize data scientists (workers) to provide high-quality inferences as requested by consumers. Inferences include predictions of arbitrary future events or difficult computations requiring specialized knowledge.

The Allora Network brings together

  - [Consumers](https://docs.allora.network/devs) who pay for and acquire inferences or expertise to be revealed
  - [Workers](https://v2.docs.allora.network/datasci) who reveal inferences
  - [Reputers](https://docs.allora.network/nops) who determine how accurate workers are after a ground truth is revealed
  - [Validators](https://docs.allora.network/nops) who secure protocol state, history, and reward distributions

With these ingredients, the Allora Network is able to continuously learn and improve itself over time producing inferences that are more accurate than the most accurate participant.

Allora Worker nodes are the interfaces between data scientists' models and the Allora Network. A worker node is a machine-intelligent application registered on the Allora chain that provides inference/prediction on a particular topic it's subscribed to and gets rewarded based on the inference quality.

This blueprint is designed to assist in deploying a single Allora [worker node](https://v2.docs.allora.network/datasci) on AWS. It is intended for use in development, testing, or Proof of Concept (PoC) purposes.
